# Blog using Ember.js and Rails as Backend

This is rather an example and test. I want to see, how good the two techniques actually mingle.

## Ember.js

I want to use the 1.0 version of Ember.js, and before that the newest RC

## Rails

Newest stable vanilla rails

## Ruby 1.9.3

This should suffice, no need to update to not yet finished Ruby 2.0 (and probably not for some time forth)

## Todos
